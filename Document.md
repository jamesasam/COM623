# Introduction
This project focused on creating the designs made in Assessment 1 and turning them into a functional Single Page Application (SPA). My problem statement in my first assignment was to make Solent students more aware of events happening around the university. The mobile SPA version will notify students of events and the desktop version gives students a clear vision of recent bookings. 

# Methodology

We already chose an overarching methodology for Assessment One but we need a development methodology for this assessment. The methodolgy has to be chosen carefully as it has to work with a small-scale project. 

I have chosen to use the 'Agile' methodology as I believe this best suits my project. Agile methodology is where the project is collabroatively worked on with users giving feedback at each stage. For example, I used feedback from the first assignement to help improve this iteration of the project. Furthermore, Agile is also about creating user stories and how these have been incorporated into the project. In the appendix I explain each user story and how they fit into the SPA. I read an Article by ZenKit which goes into detail of Agile development and the history of it. The main advantage of using Agile is that the product is always being improved and will follow the user's visions closely. 

I chose events based on what I had heard from fellow peers in a survey I previously created, the majority didn't want to create their own events so the SPA would have more focus on pre-created events around the University. The home page of the SPA opens with the user's recent bookings on cards, these are reminders of what is upcoming for them. 

Since I adopted the Agile methodology, I always want feedback and further ideas from the users. So to make sure this would happen, I added a contacts page to the SPA where students would be linked to my email where they could send me feedback or enquiries. It is always paramount you understand the user needs as the SPA is meant to be helping them solve the problem.

A disadvantage of using agile methodology is that you may feel like you never get a final version of a project as you're always improving it following user feedback. At some point you may have to stop listening to user feedback and commit to a final iteration of the product. 

# Future Features
In the future the app will include all the proposed features from Assessment One such as user authenication, booking system. These would have been included already if time and resources had been used more successfully.

The proposed user system would let users book events, create events and view recent bookings. There would be several ways to log in which include Facebook, Google and Email (University Email). Once my knowledge of react has increased this would be easier to implement. 

Furthermore, a Friends list system could be put into place to allow users to add friends to their events from inside the app. It won't ever turn into a social media network but it would be good to allow friends to add each other to events happening around the university. 

# Conclusion and Results

To conclude, unfortunately the SPA didn't solve the issues as much as I wanted them too. This was because my design wasn't up to scratch by the time the project was due to be handed in. Furthermore, time management became an issue as two assessments had been due within a week of each other so the focus drifted between the two quite often. However, I think with a few more iterations my solution would be the ideal one for students who kept being made unaware of events. 

Issues also cropped up with Firebase which is a service provided by Google to help use User Authenication, Databases etc. I had only used this previously once or twice so my knowledge wasn't the best. Therefore, I couldn't implement the login page, signup page or include the booking system. These are vital parts of my project so my design is a lot more simple now. Furthermore, lessons have been learned to manage time better to make sure to get a workable SPA. 

With the ongoing pandemic it is hard to work as normal with added stresses from working from home and navigating new modules online. This has meant that quite often the feedback I needed for my SPA wasn't there as I couldn't meet with fellow students to discuss changes. Furthermore, I could ask family for feedback but their feedback on web design is limited. However, the solution videos on the notes were very helpful and I managed to deploy on firebase In my own time I will take the time to learn more about user authenication. 

The final design currently isn't brilliant but it captures the essence of my design from assigment one and there is potential for improved iterations in the future. Furthermore, I think the problem statement has been met partially but with more time spent and Firebase mastered it would be the perfect solution.

# Appendix

## User Stories

I chose to focus on one student called "Hannah" and the SPA is designed to show her recent bookings. Furthermore, her profile picture is on the top right. In further iterations clicking the picture will take you to settings and log out. The recent bookings include events that I thought would be popular for a student such as cinema, FIFA tournament with friends. I also added study as of course this is also an important part of university life.
